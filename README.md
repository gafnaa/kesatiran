# Kesatiran Webpage

This is a web project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to introduce my friend group.  
The website features an introduction to each member, a section about them, and showcases creative works or projects they've made.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the app by modifying the file at `app/page.js`. Changes are automatically reflected in the browser.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Geist, a modern font family by Vercel.
